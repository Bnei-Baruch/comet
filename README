How to run CometDServer and Test client
---------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
1) You have to have Java 1.6
2) Download "lib" directory from: https://github.com/Bnei-Baruch/chat.git
   (Note CDS.jar is actually all CometDServer source file in a jar file)
3) Download the CometDClient project
   
Running the server
- Run the following java command from "lib" directory (Note: In windows replace ":" with ";"!!!):
  "java -cp cometd-java-server-2.1.0.beta2.jar:bayeux-api-2.1.0.beta2.jar:cometd-java-client-2.1.0.beta2.jar:cometd-java-common-2.1.0.beta2.jar:javax.servlet.jar:jetty-client-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-continuation-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-http-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-io-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-security-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-server-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-servlet-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:jetty-util-7.2.2.v20101205.jar:junit-4.8.2.jar:CDS.jar:mysql-connector-java-5.1.14-bin.jar:mail.jar:activation.jar org.BB.interactive.CometDServerRunner 80"
- If problems with permission in unix add "sudo" before the command.
- If port 80 is already used, you can try running any other port, 
  but in this case you have to change the port in chat_index.html
  ...
  contextPath: "localhost:80"
  ...

Running the Test client
Open in any browser chat_index.html from CometDClient project
Write in browser: "file:///   ...    /CometDClient/src/chat_index.html"

This project uses open source client UI: https://github.com/dexterpu/jquery.ui.chatbox
